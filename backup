# This is a simple script to backup your data using Duplicity
# (clearly you need to install it). It is supposed to be a
# daily cronjob to backup the home directory of the current
# user, encrypt it with an encryption key and them sync it
# with a WebDAV service like Nextcloud or Owncloud.
#
# You first need to set up two files inside ~/.duplicity:
#     - server: it contains the information on the server
#         - DEST: the URL of the WebDAV connetion
#         - USR:  the username of the service
#         - PSW:  the password relative to the username
#     - gpg: it contains the information on the GNUPG keys
#         - KEY:  the ID of the encryption key to be used
#         - PASSPHRASE: the password relative to the key
#

# For bug report or info contact Riccardo Finotello through
# the page on Gitlab: https://gitlab.com/thesfinox/dup-backup
# 
# Any help in improving the code is much appreciated.
